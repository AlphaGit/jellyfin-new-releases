# Cycle Log: Polish the New Releases view

Append only. Newest last. Every entry's `red` block is the evidence that the test
existed and failed before the implementation.

## Baseline

- suite (dotnet): `dotnet test --configuration Release` -> 301 passed, 2 failed, 303 total
- suite (node): `node --test "tests/web/*.test.js"` -> 64 passed, 0 failed
- commit: `a3b3579`
- recorded: cycle 0, before any change

## Notes and deviations

- Red at baseline, predating this feature:
  `Packaging.RepositoryManifestTests.Manifest_EverySourceUrlSharesOneSiteRoot_AndNamesItsOwnVersion`
  and `Packaging.RepositoryManifestTests.Manifest_EveryVersionCarriesItsDownloadChecksumTimestampAndJellyfin12`
  -> "repo/manifest.json lists 2 version(s), expected 1". The 0.1.1 release published a second
  version and `PublishedVersionsToday` was not raised. Not touched by this feature; the loop must
  not start until it is fixed.
